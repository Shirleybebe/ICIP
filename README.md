## To reviewer 1B7D:
#### Weakness 1:
![cam](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/49fc9b43-09b2-430e-bd54-4ec554cf528d)

Fig1: The visualization of Grad-CAM extracted from the detector on face images (The disturbance adopts the FGSM adversarial attack method, where "w/o" stands for "without" and "w" stands for "with").

Ps: This is a comparison of Grad-CAM with and without the ATEM and ESCM modules to verify that the method in this paper effectively guides and enhances the robustness of the model.

Tab1: Lax accuray on facial components and attributes datasets results under different level of perturbations.

Ps: This is a Ablation Study  to verify that the method in this paper effectively guides and enhances the robustness of the model.

#### Weakness 3:
