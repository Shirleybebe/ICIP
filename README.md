Fig1: The visualization of Grad-CAM extracted from the detector on face images (The disturbance adopts the FGSM adversarial attack method, where "w/o" stands for "without" and "w" stands for "with").

Ps: This is a comparison of Grad-CAM with and without the ATEM and ESCM modules to verify that the method in this paper effectively guides and enhances the robustness of the model.

Tab1: Lax Accuray on Facial Components and Attributes Datasets Results under Different Level of Perturbations.

Ps: This is a Ablation Study  to verify that the method in this paper effectively guides and enhances the robustness of the model.
